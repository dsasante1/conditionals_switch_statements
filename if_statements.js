//  You are building a ticket booking system for a cinema. The system needs to determine the ticket price based on the movie type, age, and seat selection. Implement the following rules using if, else if, else statements, comparison operators, and logical operators:
//
// - For regular movies:
//   - For children (age < 12), the ticket price is $8.
//   - For adults (age >= 12 and age < 65), the ticket price is $12.
//   - For seniors (age >= 65), the ticket price is $10.
//
// - For 3D movies:
//   - For children (age < 12), the ticket price is $10.
//   - For adults (age >= 12 and age < 65), the ticket price is $15.
//   - For seniors (age >= 65), the ticket price is $12.
//
// - For IMAX movies:
//   - For children (age < 12), the ticket price is $12.
//   - For adults (age >= 12 and age < 65), the ticket price is $18.
//   - For seniors (age >= 65), the ticket price is $15.
//
// - For VIP seats, add $5 to the ticket price.
//
// Implement the ticket booking system by taking inputs for movie type ("regular", "3D", or "IMAX"), age, and seat selection, and outputting the final ticket price based on the rules above.
