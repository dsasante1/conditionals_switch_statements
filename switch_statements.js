// You are building a subscription plan calculator for a fitness app. The calculator needs to determine the monthly subscription cost based on the user's selected plan and additional options. Implement the following rules using switch cases, comparison operators, and logical operators:
//
// - The available plans are: "Basic", "Standard", and "Premium".
// - The base monthly costs for each plan are: Basic - $10, Standard - $15, and Premium - $20.
// - Users can select additional options: "Personal Trainer" and "Meal Plan".
// - The Personal Trainer option costs $5 per month, and the Meal Plan option costs $8 per month.
// - If the user selects both options, an additional discount of $3 is applied.
//
// Implement the subscription plan calculator by taking inputs for the selected plan and the options, and outputting the final monthly subscription cost based on the rules above.
